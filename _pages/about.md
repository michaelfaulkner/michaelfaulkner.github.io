I'm an [Assistant Professor](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/people/michael_faulkner/) in the [Warwick Centre for Predictive Modelling](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wcpm/).  Primarily I'm a computational statistical physicist, which means that I use statistics to model many particles interacting with one another in a single system.  This allows us to predict and utilise the macroscopic properties of the materials used in modern technology.  More details can be found on my [research page](/research/), but my specialisms include:
- Emergent electrostatics, metastability and correlated dynamics in systems that experience the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, eg, certain planar magnets, superfluids and superconductors.
- Molecular simulation in soft-matter physics, with a focus on electrostatics, high precision and numerical stability.
- Monte Carlo sampling algorithms in statistical physics and Bayesian computational statistics, with a particular interest in piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) such as event-chain Monte Carlo.

I started my academic career as a PhD student at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/condensed-matter-material-physics/) and [Ecole normale sup√©rieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE/teams/physique-theorique/research-topics/statistical-physics), under the co-supervision of [Steve Bramwell](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/professor-steven-bramwell) and [Peter Holdsworth](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/research/honors-and-awards/peter-holdsworth-physicist-laboratoire-de-physique).  After a short postdoc and teaching position at [Bristol Mathematics](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/), I then moved to [Bristol Physics](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/physics/research/theory/) in August 2017 after winning an EPSRC postdoctoral research fellowship.  I was also a visiting scientist at [Ecole normale sup√©rieure](http://www.phys.ens.fr/?lang=fr) from September 2017 to October 2018, and won a Max Planck Institute research fellowship to visit the [Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems](https://www.pks.mpg.de) in Dresden in April 2018.

My research is centred on statistical physics, which means that I use statistics to model many particles interacting with one another in a single system. This allows us to predict and utilize the macroscopic properties of the materials and living matter used in modern technology and medicine. A lot of my time is spent developing computational algorithms to do this. This has led to collaborations with statisticians working in data science, where the same Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods are used. For more details, please see my [research page](/research/).

We use computational algorithms to develop and apply our models. A large amount of my time is therefore spent developing Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms. This has led to collaborations with statisticians working in data science, where the same methods are used.

My main focus is on the statistical physics of real and emergent long-range interactions, and their relationship with phase transitions in condensed matter. One application of my work is superconductivity, which is a state in which the electrical resistance of certain materials becomes zero at low temperatures. Two-dimensional and layered superconducting materials are governed by emergent long-range interactions, which drive a phase transition between the normal and superconducting states. I‚Äôm currently further developing [my model](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.155412) of the mechanics of the phase transition to improve its predictive power.
 
I also model long-range electrical interactions in biological physics and soft condensed matter, which are key to understanding a broad range of physical phenomena from protein folding in biological cells to ionic fluids in battery technology. We recently designed a [new Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5036638) for simulating electrical interactions, which we expect to outperform other modern methods when applied to these electrically charged systems.

The above work straddles the boundary between statistical physics and Bayesian computation in statistics. I also collaborate with statisticians to develop Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms for computational data science, where applicable examples include climate systems, political polling, and large-scale clinical trials in medical research. Over the next few years, we aim to make further connections between the Bayesian and physical worlds to complement my work developing new computational methods for them both.
