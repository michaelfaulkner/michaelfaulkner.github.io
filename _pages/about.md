I'm an [EPSRC research fellow](https://epsrc.ukri.org/about/people/michaelfaulkner/) at the [University of Bristol](https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/persons/michael-faulkner(76c7604a-6db1-4d4f-948e-db5a1f7afc2b).html) and a visiting scientist at [Ecole normale supérieure](http://www.phys.ens.fr/?lang=fr). Previously, I was a doctoral researcher at University College London and Ecole normale supérieure de Lyon. After receiving my doctorate in 2015, I then moved to Bristol for a short postdoc followed by a teaching position in the School of Mathematics, before then moving to the School of Physics to start my EPSRC Fellowship in August 2017.

My research is centred on statistical physics, which means that I use statistics to model many particles interacting with one another in a single system. This allows us to predict and utilize the macroscopic properties of the materials and living matter used in modern technology and medicine. A lot of my time is spent developing computational algorithms to do this. This has led to collaborations with statisticians working in data science, where the same Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods are used. For more details, please see my [research page](/research/).

We use computational algorithms to develop and apply our models. A large amount of my time is therefore spent developing Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms. This has led to collaborations with statisticians working in data science, where the same methods are used.

My main focus is on the statistical physics of real and emergent long-range interactions, and their relationship with phase transitions in condensed matter. One application of my work is superconductivity, which is a state in which the electrical resistance of certain materials becomes zero at low temperatures. Two-dimensional and layered superconducting materials are governed by emergent long-range interactions, which drive a phase transition between the normal and superconducting states. I’m currently further developing [my model](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.155412) of the mechanics of the phase transition to improve its predictive power.
 
I also model long-range electrical interactions in biological physics and soft condensed matter, which are key to understanding a broad range of physical phenomena from protein folding in biological cells to ionic fluids in battery technology. We recently designed a [new Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5036638) for simulating electrical interactions, which we expect to outperform other modern methods when applied to these electrically charged systems.

The above work straddles the boundary between statistical physics and Bayesian computation in statistics. I also collaborate with statisticians to develop Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms for computational data science, where applicable examples include climate systems, political polling, and large-scale clinical trials in medical research. Over the next few years, we aim to make further connections between the Bayesian and physical worlds to complement my work developing new computational methods for them both.
