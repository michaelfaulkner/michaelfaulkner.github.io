Statistical physics makes predictions about the collective behaviour of large numbers of interacting particles â€” often with a focus on how that collective behaviour leads to phase transitions, such as the freezing of a liquid into a solid.

One of the main focusses of my research has been a special phase transition that occurs in a broad class of 2D materials.  One example material is the superconducting film â€” where superconductivity is the state of zero electrical resistance achieved by certain materials at low temperature.  I recently discovered the [symmetry-breaking mechanism](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.085405) that provokes the superconducting state.  This built on [my model](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.155412) for the ergodic freezing of global topological twists (i.e. Chern numbers) at the transition â€” which provided the first description of broken ergodicity at low temperature.  The two properties are [connected by emergent electrostatics](https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/add7fd), and experimentalists had previously [used the latter as a base explanation](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.134503) for strongly correlated resistance fluctuations at the superconducting transition in films of lanthanum strontium copper oxide.  I am now applying my symmetry-breaking framework to develop a full explanation for these strongly correlated dynamics near the transition.

To make predictions about the collective behaviour, however, we typically have to simulate the interactions between the particles.  One of the main challenges of statistical physics â€” and one of my primary research interests â€” is therefore the development of efficient simulation algorithms.  For example, my collaborators and I designed an [event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5036638) for simulating an atomistic water model â€” a real challenge due to the electrostatic interactions.  This simulation method is based on piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) which usually mix faster than the stochastic dynamics of standard Markov-chain Monte Carlo, and also guarantee numerical stability, unlike molecular-dynamics simulations.  We therefore expect our accompanying open-source software application [JeLLyFysh](https://github.com/jellyfysh/JeLLyFysh) to outperform other modern methods when applied rolled out in soft-matter physics.

The above work straddles the boundary between statistical physics and Bayesian computation in mathematical statistics.  I also collaborate with mathematical statisticians to [develop Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02649) for computational data science.  More recently, my colleague and I wrote an [in-depth paper on statistical physics and its sampling algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04751), but in the language of statistics and machine learning.  This will accelerate innovation and cross-pollination of knowledge between the fields, by strengthening understanding within each discipline of the goals and nomenclature of the other field. We now plan to use this basis to explore correlated dynamics at phase transitions across statistical science.

My research focuses on the statistical physics of real and emergent Coulomb liquids, where I specialise in:
- Theory and simulation of emergent planar Coulomb liquids, such as magnets, superfluids and superconductors.
- Molecular simulation in soft-matter physics, with a focus on Coulomb liquids, high precision and numerical stability.
- Monte Carlo sampling algorithms in statistical physics and Bayesian computational statistics.

My key ðŸ”‘ scientific achievements split between my three interconnected specialisms:

### Planar materials
- Discovered [general symmetry breaking at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.085405).  This resolved the paradox of symmetry breaking being observed in many BKT experiments in spite of a predicted absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking.  Examples include [superconducting films of lanthanum strontium copper oxide (LSCO)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.134503).  The result provides a model for directional mixing (or memory) timescales in a wide array of experimental systems.
- Defined the above new concept â€” [general symmetry breaking](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.085405) â€” which encompasses both spontaneous symmetry breaking and the experimental anomalies.
- Discovered [topological ergodicity breaking at the BKT transition](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.155412) in the 2D lattice-field Coulomb liquid (with [Steve Bramwell](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/professor-steven-bramwell) and [Peter Holdsworth](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/research/honors-and-awards/peter-holdsworth-physicist-laboratoire-de-physique)).  This was cited as a possible explanation for [strongly correlated dynamics](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.134503) at the superconducting transition in the LSCO film and proved to induce the above general symmetry breaking.
- Developed the grand-canonical analogue of the [Maggs lattice-field model of Coulomb liquids](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.196402) and showed its equivalence to [the Villain model](https://doi.org/10.1051/jphys:01975003606058100) of planar magnets (see Section II and Appendix B of [the paper on topological ergodicity breaking](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.155412)).  We then...
- ...presented an [electric-field representation of the harmonic XY model](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/aa523f) â€” a more realistic model of planar magnets, superfluids and superconductors â€” which mapped the topological nonergodicity to the ergodic exclusion of global phase twists in the magnetic spins / condensate wavefunction.
- [Collated and expanded on the above concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12186).  This elucidated fully the intimate connection between the topological and symmetry-breaking properties of the BKT transition.

### Molecular simulation and event-chain Monte Carlo
- Designed [an event-chain algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5036638) for numerically stable all-atom molecular Coulomb simulations in soft matter (with [Liang Qin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rGW6nKUAAAAJ), [Tony Maggs](https://turner.pct.espci.fr/~amaggs/index2.html) and [Werner Krauth](http://www.lps.ens.fr/~krauth/index.php/Main_Page)).  This is the only molecular simulation algorithm that mixes (equilibrates from a random initial configuration) Coulomb-based models in *O(N log(N))* computations, where *N* is the number of particles.  It also achieves machine precision and is the basis of...
- ...our mediator-based Python-C application [JeLLyFysh](https://github.com/jellyfysh/JeLLyFysh), which we set out in detail [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2020.107168) with [Philipp HÃ¶llmer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TzZkSGMAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=sra).

### Sampling algorithms and interface with Bayesian computational statistics
- Presented an [in-depth paper on statistical physics and its sampling algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04751), but in the language of statistics and machine learning (with statistician [Sam Livingstone](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-information/staff/dr-samuel-livingstone)).  We took a particular interest in phase transitions and event-chain Monte Carlo, presenting the latter in the language of PDMPs in Bayesian computations.  This project used [super-aLby](https://github.com/michaelfaulkner/super-aLby) and [xy-type-models](https://github.com/michaelfaulkner/xy-type-models) to simulate the models presented.  We now plan to use this basis to explore correlated dynamics at phase transitions across statistical science â€” as we identified analogies with the emergent planar Coulomb liquid described above.
- Designed [super-relativistic Monte Carlo](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asz013) for high-stability simulation of probability models in Bayesian computation (with statisticians [Sam Livingstone](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-information/staff/dr-samuel-livingstone) and [Gareth Roberts](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/roberts/) â€” see section 5.2 of [the linked paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asz013) for details).  By slowing down the Newtonian dynamics in high-gradient regions of probability space, this new simulation algorithm circumvents the numerical instabilities of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo when applied to light-tailed probability distributions.  It also achieves machine precision and is the basis of our Python application [super-aLby](https://github.com/michaelfaulkner/super-aLby).
