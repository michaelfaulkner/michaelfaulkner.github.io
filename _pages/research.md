My research focuses on the statistical physics of real and emergent Coulomb liquids. One application of my work is superconductivity, which is a state in which the electrical resistance of certain materials becomes zero at low temperatures. Thin-film and layered type-II superconductors behave as emergent two-dimensional Coulomb liquids, which we use to model the phase transition between the normal and superconducting states. Iâ€™m currently further developing [my model](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.155412) of the two-dimensional electrolyte to explain the highly correlated resistance fluctuations that were [recently measured](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.134503) at the superconducting transition in lanthanum strontium copper oxide.

I also model real electrostatics in biological and soft-matter physics, which are key to understanding a broad range of physical phenomena from protein folding in biological cells to ionic fluids in battery technology. We recently designed an [event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5036638) for simulating electrical interactions in an atomistic water model. This sampling method is based on piecewise deterministic Markov processes, which usually mix faster than the stochastic dynamics of standard Markov-chain Monte Carlo, and also guarantee numerical stability, unlike molecular-dynamics simulations. We therefore expect our algorithm to outperform other modern methods when applied to these electrically charged systems. We're currently working on this benchmarking study.

The above work straddles the boundary between statistical physics and Bayesian computation in statistics. I also collaborate with statisticians to [develop Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02649) for computational data science, where applicable examples include climate systems, political polling, and large-scale clinical trials in medical research. Over the next few years, we aim to make further connections between the Bayesian and physical worlds to complement my work developing new computational methods for them both.

My research focuses on the statistical physics of real and emergent Coulomb liquids, where I specialise in:
- Theory and simulation of emergent planar Coulomb liquids, such as magnets, superfluids and superconductors.
- Molecular simulation in soft-matter physics, with a focus on Coulomb liquids, high precision and numerical stability.
- Monte Carlo sampling algorithms in statistical physics and Bayesian computational statistics.

## Key ðŸ”‘ scientific achievements
### Planar materials
- Discovered [general symmetry breaking at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03699).  This resolved the paradox of symmetry breaking being observed in many BKT experiments in spite of a predicted absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking.  Examples include [superconducting films of lanthanum strontium copper oxide (LSCO)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.134503).  The result provides a model for symmetry-restoring (or memory) timescales in a wide array of experimental systems.
- Defined the above new concept â€” [general symmetry breaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03699) â€” which encompasses both spontaneous symmetry breaking and the experimental anomalies.
- Discovered [topological ergodicity breaking at the BKT transition](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.155412) in the 2D lattice-field Coulomb liquid (with [Steve Bramwell](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/professor-steven-bramwell) and [Peter Holdsworth](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/research/honors-and-awards/peter-holdsworth-physicist-laboratoire-de-physique)).  This was cited as a possible explanation for [correlated resistance fluctuations](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.134503) at the superconducting transition in the LSCO film and proved to induce the above general symmetry breaking.
- Developed the grand-canonical analogue of the [Maggs lattice-field model of Coulomb liquids](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.196402) and showed its equivalence to [the Villain model](https://doi.org/10.1051/jphys:01975003606058100) of planar magnets (see Section II and Appendix B of [the paper on topological ergodicity breaking](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.155412)).  We then...
- ...presented an [electric-field representation of the harmonic XY model](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/aa523f) â€” a more realistic model of planar magnets, superfluids and superconductors â€” which mapped the topological ergodicity breaking to the ergodic exclusion of global phase twists in the magnetic spins / condensate wavefunction.
### Molecular simulation and event chain Monte Carlo
- Designed [an event-chain algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5036638) for numerically stable all-atom molecular Coulomb simulations in soft matter (with [Liang Qin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rGW6nKUAAAAJ), [Tony Maggs](https://turner.pct.espci.fr/~amaggs/index2.html) and [Werner Krauth](http://www.lps.ens.fr/~krauth/index.php/Main_Page)).  This is the only molecular simulation algorithm that mixes (equilibrates from a random initial configuration) Coulomb-based models in *O(N log(N))* computations, where *N* is the number of particles.  It also achieves machine precision and is the basis of...
- ...our mediator-based Python-C application [JeLLyFysh](https://github.com/jellyfysh/JeLLyFysh), which we set out in detail [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2020.107168) (also with [Philipp HÃ¶llmer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TzZkSGMAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=sra)).
### Sampling algorithms and interface with (Bayesian) computational statistics
- Presented an [in-depth review of statistical physics and its sampling algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04751), but in the language of statistics and machine learning (with statistician [Sam Livingstone](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-information/staff/dr-samuel-livingstone)).  This will accelerate innovation and cross-pollination of knowledge between the two fields, by strengthening understanding within each discipline of the goals and nomenclature of the other field.  This project uses [super-aLby](https://github.com/michaelfaulkner/super-aLby) and [xy-type-models](https://github.com/michaelfaulkner/xy-type-models) to simulate the models presented.  We are now building on the connections presented in the paper.
- Designed [super-relativistic Monte Carlo](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asz013) for high-stability simulation of probability models in Bayesian computation (with statisticians [Sam Livingstone](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-information/staff/dr-samuel-livingstone) and [Gareth Roberts](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/roberts/) â€” see section 5.2 of [the linked paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asz013) for details).  By slowing down the Newtonian dynamics in high-gradient regions of probability space, this new simulation algorithm circumvents the numerical instabilities of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo when applied to light-tailed probability distributions.  It also achieves machine precision and is the basis of our Python application [super-aLby](https://github.com/michaelfaulkner/super-aLby).
