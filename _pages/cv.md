<!---
I teach coding to 8- to 14-year-old state-school students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The initiative is organized by DigiLocal HBB to address the imbalance of people from disadvantaged backgrounds working in the tech sector. I helped to build a long-term partnership between Digilocal and the University of Bristol, and am also a mentor for the Social Mobility Foundation.
 
I was also involved in widening-participation projects while at UCL. During the summer of 2014, I voluntarily devised and ran a quantum mechanics summer school for 17-year-old state-school students on free school meals through the charity in2scienceUK. In 2012-13, I voluntarily tutored maths to 15-year-old state-school students on free school meals through the charity Action Tutoring.
 
Widening participation in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) addresses both socio-economic imbalance in society and the problems associated with missing a large proportion of talent from an entire demographic. I am an ambassador of the educational charity STEM Learning.
