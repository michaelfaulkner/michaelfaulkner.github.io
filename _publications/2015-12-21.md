We devised a protocol by which to measure the effective magnetic XY critical exponent β = 3π^2/128 in superfluid helium-4 films. This elucidated and provided a platform for universal finite-size scaling in condensate films and layers. This is an experimental article. We dedicated it to the memory of our friend and colleague Maxime Clusel, with whom we had many stimulating discussions on related topics.
