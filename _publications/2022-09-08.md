Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a foundational concept in the characterisation of phase transitions.  Certain experimental systems produce, however, symmetry-breaking phenomena at the topological Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, despite spontaneous symmetry breaking being precluded by the vanishing of the expected norm of the *U(1)* order parameter in the thermodynamic limit.  Examples include recent observations of experimental symmetry breaking in superconducting films. While the slow approach to the thermodynamic limit is known to be at the root of this paradox, the dynamical symmetry-breaking framework required for the superconducting film remains unresolved.  Here we provide this by introducing the broader concept of *general symmetry breaking*.  This encompasses both spontaneous symmetry breaking and the experimental anomalies by allowing the expected norm of the order parameter to go to zero in the thermodynamic limit, provided its directional phase fluctuations are asymptotically smaller, returning zero following the thermodynamic and then long-time limits.  This explicitly demonstrates that the order parameter arbitrarily chooses a well-defined direction in the thermodynamic limit, reflecting experimental *U(1)* phase fluctuations being negligible compared to the expected norm at arbitrarily large system size. Our results provide a model for symmetry-restoring timescales in a wide array of experimental systems.
