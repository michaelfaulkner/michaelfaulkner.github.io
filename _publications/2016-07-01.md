We extended the idea of [topological-sector fluctuations](/publication/2015-04-10) to quantum and thermal phase slips in a model of strongly interacting bosons in a ring lattice. This provided strong evidence for the phase-slip fluctuations approaching a jump (distinct from the BKT universal jump) at the superfluid - Mott insulator transition. This paper was submitted by invitation. It is a special issue article on strongly interacting quantum gases in one dimension.
