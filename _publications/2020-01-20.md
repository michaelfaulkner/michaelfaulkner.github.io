We present JeLLyFysh-Version1.0, an open-source Python application for event-chain Monte Carlo (ECMC), an event-driven irreversible Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm for classical *N*-body simulations in statistical mechanics, biophysics and electrochemistry. The application’s architecture mirrors the mathematical formulation of ECMC. Local potentials, long-range Coulomb interactions and multi-body bending potentials are covered, as well as bounding potentials and cell systems including the cell-veto algorithm. Configuration files illustrate a number of specific implementations for interacting atoms, dipoles, and water molecules.
