We identified topological-sector fluctuations in the high-temperature phase of the two-dimensional electrolyte with an auxiliary field. Our framework augments the charge-interaction representation of Kosterlitz and Thouless to identify the topological sectors of the electric field, which reflect charge tracing closed paths around the torus. Topological-sector fluctuations are absent in the low-temperature phase, where charges are confined in neutral pairs.  This reflects a nonergodicity in the electric field. In contrast, topological-sector fluctuations are nonzero in the ergodic, high-temperature phase, where the charges are deconfined. Topological order is then defined by the absence of topological-sector fluctuations. This nonergodicity was cited as a base explanation for the nonergodic dynamics measured in layered cuprates at the superconducting transition [citing article]. Paper accepted with zero revisions.
